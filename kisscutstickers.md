## Kiss-cut Stickers

We used the print-then cut feature in Cricut to create these stickers for the Referendum at the BCITSA. Using Avery Label Paper (30605) we wanted to create four strips of stickers for BCIT students to get inside of the monthly magazine.
### Setting Review

#### Best Settings:

Material: Adhesive Foil (108)
Pressure: Default
Effect: Perfect Kiss-Cut with full cut through the sticker side and no marks on the backing. 

#### Next-Best Settings 

Material: Window Cling (100)
Pressure: More
Effect: Kiss-cut, completely cutting through the sticker side while only occasionally leaving a faint impression on the backing.
Downside: One extra setting to select when going through the process (slows it down)

#### Other Settings Tested:
The numbers in parenthesis are the pressure settings listed on the Cricut site, and don't account for more/less pressure.

- Sticker Paper (270) Default Pressure: Die cut
- Sticker Paper (270)  Light Pressure: Die cut
- Washi .006 version (70) Light Pressure: didn’t cut through top layer
- Washi .006 version (70) Default Pressure: didn’t cut through top layer
- Washi Sheet (85), Default Pressure: Almost through, not quite! 
- Washi Sheet (85), More Pressure: Kiss-cut with some sections where the cut isn't quite all the way through. Works, but tears occasionally. May work great with slightly thinner label sheets! 

### Other Tips

- Use a light-grip mat to reduce curling
- To reduce curling further, remove the sheet by flipping the mat upside down and bending the mat (not the paper) when removing the sheet
- The automatic file bleed, while useful, isn't adjustable/large, so create it manually with the stickers

### Step-by-step

- When creating the stickers, create individual stickers first as PNGs (add white borders around images, and use transparent backgrounds) 
- Upload the files to Cricut Design Space, as "print then cut" items 
- Place them on the design workspace as you'd like them (you have to keep them within a 6.75" x 9.25" area)
- Select all items and "attach" them before moving to the next step
- Select "Make"
